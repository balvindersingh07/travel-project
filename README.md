# Travel-Project
The travel website App was built using the following technologies: React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps. HTML/CSS: The standard markup language and styling language for creating web pages.
Tour &amp; Travel Project (Using Html, Css,Javascript).

Here I used <b>Html, Css & javascript</b> To create the front end part of the website and for storing the Contact Information in the Database we used <b>php</b> as a backend language.

The HomePage of the Website is with<b> main.html</b> file.
